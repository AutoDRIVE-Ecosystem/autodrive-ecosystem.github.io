## About

<p align="justify">
<b>F1TENTH Autonomous Racing</b> is a semi-regular competition organized by an international community of researchers, engineers, and autonomous systems enthusiasts. The teams participating in the <b>21st F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix</b> at <a href="https://iros2024-abudhabi.org">IROS 2024</a> will write software for a 1:10 scaled autonomous race car to fulfill the objectives for the competition: <b><i>drive fast but don’t crash!</i></b>
</p>

<p align="justify">
This time, we are organizing the first ever <b>F1TENTH Sim Racing League</b>, which leverages <a href="https://autodrive-ecosystem.github.io">AutoDRIVE Ecosystem</a> to model and simulate the digital twin of an F1TENTH racecar within a virtual racetrack. Please see the accompanying video for a glimpse of the F1TENTH digital twins in action.

</center>

<p align="justify">
The main focus of the Sim Racing League is a virtual competition with simulated cars and environments, which is accessible to everyone across the globe. For the <a href="https://iros2024-abudhabi.org">IROS 2024</a> competition, each team will be provided with a standardized simulation setup (in the form of a digital twin of the F1TENTH vehicle, and a digital twin of the Porto racetrack) within the high-fidelity <a href="https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Simulator">AutoDRIVE Simulator</a>. Additionally, teams will also be provided with a working implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Devkit">AutoDRIVE Devkit</a> to get started with developing their autonomy algorithms. Teams will have to develop perception, planning, and control algorithms to parse the real-time sensor data streamed from the simulator and generate control commands to be fed back to the simulated vehicle.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The competition will take place in 2 stages:
</p>

<ul class="justify-list">
  <li><b>Qualification Race:</b> Teams will demonstrate their ability to complete multiple laps around the practice track without colliding with the track bounds at run time.</li>
  <li><b>Time-Attack Race:</b> Teams will compete against the clock, on a previously unseen racetrack, to secure a position on the leaderboard.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
Since the vehicle, the sensors, the simulator, and the devkit are standardized, teams must develop robust racing algorithms that can deal with the uncertainties of an unseen racetrack.
</p>

!!! Tip
    If you are interested in autonomously racing physical F1TENTH vehicles, please check out the website for [21st F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix](https://iros2024-race.f1tenth.org), which will be held in person at <a href="https://iros2024-abudhabi.org">IROS 2024</a>. You can always register and compete in both physical and virtual competitions!

<a href="https://autodrive-ecosystem.github.io/">AutoDRIVE</a> is envisioned to be an open, comprehensive, flexible and integrated cyber-physical ecosystem for enhancing autonomous driving research and education. It bridges the gap between software simulation and hardware deployment by providing the <a href="https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Simulator">AutoDRIVE Simulator</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Testbed">AutoDRIVE Testbed</a>, a well-suited duo for real2sim and sim2real transfer targeting vehicles and environments of varying scales and operational design domains. It also offers <a href="https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE/tree/AutoDRIVE-Devkit">AutoDRIVE Devkit</a>, a developer's kit for rapid and flexible development of autonomy algorithms using a variety of programming languages and software frameworks. For the Sim Racing League, teams will develop their autonomous racing algorithms using the AutoDRIVE Devkit to interface with the AutoDRIVE Simulator in real-time.

<a href="https://f1tenth.org/">F1TENTH</a> is an <a href="https://f1tenth.org/about.html">international community</a> of researchers, engineers, and autonomous systems enthusiasts. It is centered around the idea of converting a 1:10 scale RC car into an autonomous vehicle for research and education; check out the <a href="https://f1tenth.org/build.html">documentation</a> to build your own F1TENTH autonomous racecar. Additionally, if you are new to the field of autonomous racing, you can refer to the complete <a href="https://f1tenth.org/learn.html">course material</a>, which is open sourced. If you already have some experience with autonomous racing, feel free to delve deeper into the <a href="https://f1tenth.org/research.html">research</a> enabled by F1TENTH. Lastly, you can also check out the physical <a href="https://f1tenth.org/race.html">F1TENTH races</a> that are being organized all around the world. For the Sim Racing League, teams will not require a physical F1TENTH vehicle; however, the learning resources can certainly be useful to get your autonomous racing fundamentals right!

## Registration

<p align="justify">
This competition is open to everyone around the world - students, researchers, hobbyists, professionals, or anyone else who is interested. A team can consist of multiple teammates. Teams with only one person are also allowed.
</p>

<center>
[:material-file-document-edit: Registration Form](https://forms.gle/hBCctUaHcvFoB9zHA){.md-button}
</center>

<p align="justify">
Registration for the Sim Racing League is free of cost and separate from the Physical Racing League and the conference registrations themselves. The above form signs you up only for the Sim Racing League, and for its orientation and information sessions. Although you can participate in the Sim Racing League without attending the conference, we strongly encourage all competition participants to attend the conference in person. This will help you connect with the broader AutoDRIVE and F1TENTH communities, and you can also witness/participate in the physical F1TENTH autonomous racing competition!
